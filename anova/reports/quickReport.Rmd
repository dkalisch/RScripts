```{r setup,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,include=TRUE,cache=TRUE}
# Its a good idea to start any rmarkdown document with a block like this one to set knit defaults, setup the bibliography, and so forth.
setwd("~/projects/RScripts/anova/")

# This is also a good place to setup any ggplot2 themes for the document using ggplot2::theme_set()
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
ERWaiting.summary
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ERWaiting.aov.summary
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r echo=FALSE}
bp
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pf
```
